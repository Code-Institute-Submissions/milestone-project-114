# Deathfret Guitar

## Milestone Project 4 - Full Stack Frameworks with Django

The final project as part of [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net)'s full stack software development course ties together all aspects of full stack developemnt
in one comprehensive application. Using the Django full stack framework, the goal is to create an online service app that will be able to handle user authenticaation as well
as a payment system for a product and/or service.

As a guitarist with over 20 years experience playing, recording and touring, I have always dreamt of creating a community of up and coming players, in which the more prevalant
who have anything to teach will be able to do so for a subscribing user. Specifically I have been a part of the extreme metal niche of the industry for many years and have noticed that
such a platform does not currently exist for this particular genre.

The site will be a subscription based site, where a member will be able to access lessons and masterclasses of talented guitarists for a small monthly, or yearly fee. The idea will be
for the site owner(s) to source players who would be willing to write and record a lesson series, which will then be available for paying members in their very own members area. At the time of writing however, this collaborative content has not yet been created, so while the project is being built, only example lesson plans by sourced players will be used. The structure of the site
will be the same.

The site will also feature a webstore of branded merchandise that a subscribing user or shopper will be able to purchase.
